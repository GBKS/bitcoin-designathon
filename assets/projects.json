            "Description": "Problem: \nAfter using bitcoin for a while, or after mixing larger amounts of bitcoin using popular CoinJoin tools, users will accumulate many UTXOs in their wallet. This bloats the UTXO set. But more importantly for the user, this creates a privacy problem when the user wants to transfer an amount of bitcoin that is larger than any of the UTXOs in their wallet: to make this transfer, they will need to combine multiple UTXOs in their wallet into a single larger output, creating a public link between the inputs of the transaction and making it possible to infer common ownership of them. As the user collects more and more UTXOs, they become more and more cumbersome to manage while preserving privacy.\n\nSee also \"common input ownership heuristic\" and \"unnecessary input heuristic\" sections of the [privacy page in the bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy).\n\nSolution: \n[compactor] is an app that is used to privately consolidate bitcoin UTXOs using a zero-knowledge sidechain (such as zSide by Nikita Chashchinskii) to consolidate bitcoin UTXOs in a way that does not create a public link between the UTXOs.\n\n[Wireframes and further explanation](https://github.com/john-light/compactor/blob/main/docs/%5Bcompactor%5D%20-%20shared.pdf)\n\nSlack channel: [#designathon-compactor](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C0459PJFSBA)\n"

However, merchants that use BTCPay sometimes proudly display it on their website or social media. To help various merchants advertise that they accept bitcoin and use btcpay, we've created a directory where anyone can self-list themselves. The goal of this project is to completely re-design and improve directory. Right now all the listings are on a single homepage with infinite scroll. We'd like to propose that every merchant has their own page. So redesigning the homepage, a submission page and a single merchant page would be the goal of this project.\n\nJoin the Slack channel here: [#designathon-btcpay](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C044FHE2STB)\n\nBTCPay Directory can be seen here [https://directory.btcpayserver.org](https://directory.btcpayserver.org/)\nOur Design guidelines can be found here [https://design.btcpayserver.org](https://design.btcpayserver.org/)\n\nDesigners are completely free to make their own design choices, we'd love you to be creative and help merchants who accept bitcoin get more visibility. \n"
