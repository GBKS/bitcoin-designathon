            "Description": "**What is this?**\n\\- An exploration tool for the Bitcoin open-source ecosystem.\n\\- An easier way to point to innovation.\n\\- An easier way for someone to find interesting things to work on.\n\\- (extend) A platform to help financially support open-source contributors?\n\n**Origin Story**\nGoing down the open-source developer path, I wanted to educate myself around the funding opportunities that exist. That's how I [initially came up](https://twitter.com/kouloumos/status/1476570418521772033) with [whofundsbitcoin.com](http://whofundsbitcoin.com/), a website showcasing those that fund Bitcoin development. \n\nFrom the start, I didn't want that project to only be about funding, rather to further develop it as the go-to resource for anyone eager to explore what individual Bitcoin developers are working on, unraveling all the cool things happening on Bitcoin. This was meant to be an exploration tool for the Bitcoin open-source ecosystem. **I soon realized that funding-centric was not the way to go. It should be project-centric.** \n\nThat's how **\"Who Funds Bitcoin\" evolved to \"Who Builds Bitcoin\".**\n\n**Design Briefing**\nI’m playing with this idea in my mind for close to a year now. I've implemented it once (with [whofundsbitcoin.com](http://whofundsbitcoin.com/)) and **I’ve since observing shortcomings and thinking about the next iteration.** \n\nBelow are some of my thoughts on how I think this could be set up for success.\n\n**Visualizations**\nThe basis of the idea is a visualization. \"Who Funds Bitcoin\" uses nodes for entities and edges for the funding connections between them. This becomes very messy, very fast. \n\nA better idea could be click-to-expand like what [https://lnlighthouse.online/](https://lnlighthouse.online/https://lnlighthouse.online/) ([src](https://twitter.com/saiy2k/status/1560640578467303429)) uses. And you could click something like [this](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fkouloumos%2FLODruWQhGe.jpeg?alt=media&token=5ff7c088-d0de-4567-865c-0dc4e609398c) - Bitcoin as the central hexagon and on the outside: P2P, Privacy, Mining, Wallet, Bitcoin Core, Lightning, etc. You click on those and it further expands until you reach the contributors of each part, the people working on each innovation. \n\n**Attractive for contributors**\nMaintaining an aggregation side is hard. And even if you do so, you'll probably missing stuff. You have to make it self-reporting. Think about [https://bitcoindevlist.com/](https://bitcoindevlist.com/https://bitcoindevlist.com/) where developers submit their own information for people to support them. \n\nThat means that every contributor listed on the site is updating his own information. Think something like:\n`{\"name\": \"Andreas\", \"github\": \"...\", \"twitter\": \"...\", \"description\": \"...\", \"tags\": [\"Bitcoin Core\"]}`\n The tags attribute will then be used to add each one on the visualization. \n\nTaking it a step further, clicking on each contributors can open a sidebar with a **timeline of work related updates**. A contributor can maybe add an update once a quarter with his/her current interest, kind of how a summary is presented on funding announcements. **This could evolve to a better platform for financial support of contributors.**\n\n_Although I am ignoring some technical details since this is design talk, this part gets a bit more technical._\n**You now need a way to make this as easy as possible for contributors to self-report their own data.** I think the best tool for such a job is [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr). People will be able to use whatever tool they want to submit data and Who Builds Bitcoin will be just a client, reading data from a relay. No need for a database, therefore providing an easy, interoperable way for people to add data. \n\nI've been obsessing over this idea for a long time now but my priorities do not allow me to start writing code for this. I was looking for an opportunity to get external input and maybe some design help, therefore this is the best opportunity to let this out in the wild.\n",
